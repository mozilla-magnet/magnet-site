When Mozilla (that’s us), receives information from you, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

### Things you should know

Mozilla receives the URL broadcast by every beacon discovered in your vicinity by our app. Beacons may be provided by Mozilla or other companies. Additionally, Mozilla receives your GPS location from your phone so that we may provide you with URLs for “Points of Interest” nearby.

We display information about the URLs corresponding to those beacons or GPS locations as tiles in our app. When you click on a tile, your device’s default browser or application servicing that URL may open. We do not receive the URLs beyond the original ones for each beacon or GPS location. For example, you may browse web pages off of the original URL and we will not receive the URLs for those pages.

If you do not want us to receive the URLs announced by beacons, you should turn off the telemetry to be sent to us in Magnet’s settings.

In addition, we may receive certain  statistical data such as your:

- App install
- App launch
- List refresh
- Navigations to beacon items or Points of Interest
- Points of Interest found around your location
- Channel subscribes and unsubscribes
- Settings view opened
- Taps on settings list item items
- How often you bring the app to the background or foreground
- Opening the app from a notification
- Dismissing a notification
- App killed from task manager

This data is used to provide and improve our service. We use the services of Google Analytics to receive this data and the URLs. We encourage you to review its privacy policies and terms, as they are different from ours.

We may need to change this notice. We will post the updates.

Your continued use of Project Magnet after the update has been posted constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
